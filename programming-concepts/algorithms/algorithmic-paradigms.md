# Algorithmic Paradigms

## 1. Brute Force

Brute force algorithms are exhaustive methods of solving a problem through pure computing power and trying all possibilities to find a solution rather than using a more advanced strategy to improve overall efficiency.

**Pros: **Guaranteed to eventually find the solution

**Cons: **Inefficient, no shortcuts to improve performance.

For example, imagine you are trying to figure out a four-digit password combination. The brute force approach would test every possible combination of four-digit numbers from 0000 to 9999.** Linear search**, a method to find a target value in a given list, will traverse through the array and check each element until a match is found.

## 2. Divide and Conquer

Solves a problem by dividing it into N subproblems to an ‘atomic’ level. Each subproblem is solved individually, then combines into a solution for the original problem.

**Pros: **Effcient and powerful when dealing with problems that can be easily divided into subproblems. Also efficient in memory usage.

**Cons:** Because it is a recursive approach, it can be slow. Large recursive stacks can also consume extra space.
