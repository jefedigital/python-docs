# Underscores

Underscore(\_) is a unique character in Python. If you're a Python programmer, you probably familiar with the following syntax:

\* for \_ in range(100)

\* \_\_init\_\_(self)

\* \_ = 2

It has some special meaning in different conditions.

## 1. Use In Interpreter

Python automatically stores the value of the last expression in the interpreter to a particular variable called "\_." You can also assign these value to another variable if you want.

```
> 5 + 4
9

> _
9

> _ + 6
15
```

## 3. Use In Looping

You can use underscore(\_) as a variable in looping.
